			<h2 class="article-title">Assignment 1</h2>
			<p class="date">29 September 2022</p>
			<p>This was a fun assignment.</p>
			<p>I haven't done any web dev stuff in awhile, and I don't know that much in the first place, but it was nice to get back into it. The visual nature of front-end web development is sort of gratifying to work with, especially after working with complex, abstract command line programs in other classes.</p>
			<p>Hopefully at some point there will be an option to learn some UI/UX principles and how to translate that into HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

			<h2 class="article-title">Assignment 2</h2>
			<p class="date">21 October 2022</p>
			<p>This assignment kind of bummed me out.</p>
			<p>I really like front-end development and feel like there is so much more
			CSS stuff to learn. It would be great if this class were split into two
			classes; one for front-end and one for back-end.</p>
			<p>But the good news is that I've decided to pursue more web development
			projects on my own alongside my studies (as much as I can anyway).</p>
			<p>Anyway, this was a lot of fun and I'm loving the class so far.</p>

			<h2 class="article-title">Assignment 3</h2>
			<p class="date">7 November 2022</p>
			<p>I thought this was a challenging assingment. While JavaScript is
			similar in many ways to other languages, interacting with the DOM is a new
			paradigm for me.</p> 
			<p>Again, I feel like we just scratched the surface and that
			there's a whole world of techniques and best practices to learn. This is
			definitely my favorite CS class so far, I'm looking forward to continuing
			web dev stuff on my own.</p>
