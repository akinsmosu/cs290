			<h2 class="article-title">Assignment 1</h2>
			<p class="date">29 September 2022</p>
			<p>This was a fun assignment.</p>
			<p>I haven't done any web dev stuff in awhile, and I don't know that much in the first place, but it was nice to get back into it. The visual nature of front-end web development is sort of gratifying to work with, especially after working with complex, abstract command line programs in other classes.</p>
			<p>Hopefully at some point there will be an option to learn some UI/UX principles and how to translate that into HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
